\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

Data collected from wearable accelerometers provide continuous measurements of human movement in the real world setting and therefore have the potential to convey uncover insights about the relationship between physical activity and health. This thesis advances statistical methodology for analyzing and interpreting data collected from wearable accelerometers, with the goal of improving health monitoring and public health research, while providing scalable, open-source tools and software for the research community. 

\section{Person identification from accelerometry}

In chapter~\ref{chap:paper1}, I develop two methods for identifying individuals from their walking pattern as measured by a wearable accelerometer (walking fingerprinting). Both methods rely on leveraging the relationship between acceleration and lag acceleration at a sub-second level, which leverages differences between individuals in walking dynamics. The methods performed well in small datasets where individuals were known to be walking. In chapter~\ref{chap:paper2}, I adapted and scaled the method for the massive NHANES dataset, which is comprised of several days of accelerometry from over $15{,}000$ individuals ($>10$ Tb of data!). After applying algorithms to identify areas that were likely walking, I applied walking fingerprinting methods and was able to correctly identify individuals almost 50\% of the time. I developed an R package \texttt{accelPrint} \cite{accelprint} to enable broader use of the fingerprinting method. 

Walking fingerprinting has implications for clinical and epidemiological research. If walking patterns are unique across individuals, changes in walking patterns could be used to predict early onset of disease, changes in fall risk, or recovery trajectory from an injury; walking patterns could also be used for clustering and better understanding subgroups in a population. Future directions involve exploring these aspects of the walking fingerprint. 

\section{Complex survey function on scalar regression}
In chapter~\ref{chap:paper3}, I described the development of a method for function on scalar regression (FoSR) in complex survey settings. Since accelerometry data are often collected in large epidemiological studies, accounting for survey structure is critical for unbiased estimation and correct inference. This method allows for analysis of the relationship between a functional outcome (e.g. steps or physical activity over the course of the day) and covariates of interest. The method is implemented in an R package, \texttt{svyfosr} \cite{svyfosr}. 


\section{Conclusion}
I have developed methods for processing and analyzing sub-second wearable accelerometry data in order to identify individuals, and created a framework for complex survey function on scalar regression. These methods are all accompanied by open source code and usable R software. This work contributes to methodological and scientific advances in the fields of biostatistics, data science, and public health.
