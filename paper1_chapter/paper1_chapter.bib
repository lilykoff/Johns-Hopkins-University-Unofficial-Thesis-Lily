Gait velocity decreases, variability increases, and ability to multitask while walking is impaired as cognition declines. Changes in gait can be used to predict incident mild cognitive impairment states as well as dementia. Slow gait velocity together with a cognitive complaint, the Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome, can serve as a clinical biomarker for high risk of neurologic decline. While patients with Alzheimer's disease typically have quantitative gait impairment, those with other forms of dementia often manifest more overt, qualitative changes to walking. A variety of interventions may be useful to improve gait, including physical and cognitive rehabilitation, treatment of specific underlying causes of gait problems, and treatment of the dementia itself. Understanding the relationship between gait and dementia can elucidate pathology and improve patient care.},

	abstract = {Introduction
While fatigue is ubiquitous in old age and visibly interferes with mobility, studies have not yet examined the effects of self-reported fatigue on healthy older adult's gait. As a model that simulates this daily phenomenon, we systematically reviewed eleven studies that compared the effects of experimentally induced muscle and mental performance fatigability on gait kinematics, variability, kinetics, and muscle activity in healthy older adults.

Methods
We searched for studies in databases (PubMed and Web of Science) using Fatigue, Gait, and Clinical conditions as the main terms and extracted the data only from studies that experimentally induced fatigue by sustained muscle or mental activities in healthy older adults.

Results
Eleven studies were included. After muscle performance fatigability, six of nine studies observed increases in stride length, width, gait velocity (Effect Size [ES] range: 0.30 to 1.22), inter-stride trunk acceleration variability (ES: 2.06), and ankle muscle coactivation during gait (ES: 0.59, n = 1 study). After sustained mental activity, the coefficient of variation of stride outcomes increased (ES: 0.59 to 0.67, n = 1 study) during dual-task but not single-task walking.

Conclusion
Muscle performance fatigability affects spatial and temporal features of gait and, mainly, inter-stride trunk acceleration variability. In contrast, sustained mental activity tends only to affect step variability during dual tasking. A critical and immediate step for future studies is to determine the effects of self-reported fatigue on gait biomechanics and variability in healthy older adults to verify the viability of experimentally induced fatigue as a model for the study of gait adaptability in old age.},

	abstract = {Wearable accelerometers provide an objective measure of human physical activity. They record high frequency unlabeled three-dimensional time series data. We extract meaningful features from the raw accelerometry data and based on them develop and evaluate a classification method for the detection of walking and its sub-classes, i.e. level walking, descending stairs and ascending stairs. Our methodology is tested on a sample of 32 middle-aged subjects for whom we extracted features based on the Fourier and wavelet transforms. We build subject-specific and group-level classification models utilizing a tree-based methodology. We evaluate the effects of sensor location and tuning parameters on the classification accuracy of the tree models. In the group-level classification setting, we propose a robust feature inter-subject normalization and evaluate its performance compared to unnormalized data. The overall classification accuracy for the three activities at the subject-specific level was on average 87.6\%, with the ankle-worn accelerometers showing the best performance with an average accuracy 90.5\%. At the group-level, the average overall classification accuracy for the three activities using the normalized features was 80.2\% compared to 72.3\% for the unnormalized features. In summary, a framework is provided for better use and feature extraction from raw accelerometry data to differentiate among different walking modalities as well as considerations for study design.},

A combination of these accelerations is used for authentication. Applying two different methods, histogram similarity and cycle length, equal error rates (EER) of 5\% and 9\% were achieved, respectively.},

	abstract = {Fisher's linear discriminant analysis is a valuable tool for multigroup classification. With a large number of predictors, one can find a reduced number of discriminant coordinate functions that are "optimal" for separating the groups. With two such functions, one can produce a classification map that partitions the reduced space into regions that are identified with group membership, and the decision boundaries are linear. This article is about richer nonlinear classification schemes. Linear discriminant analysis is equivalent to multiresponse linear regression using optimal scorings to represent the groups. In this paper, we obtain nonparametric versions of discriminant analysis by replacing linear regression by any nonparametric regression method. In this way, any multiresponse regression technique (such as MARS or neural networks) can be postprocessed to improve its classification performance},

Implications of these findings are also briefly described. This update highlights the idea that while stride length, gait variability, and fractal scaling of gait are all impaired in PD, distinct mechanisms likely contribute to and are responsible for the regulation of these disparate gait properties.},

	abstract = {Human walking is a complex task which includes hundreds of muscles, bones and joints working together to deliver harmonic movements with the need of finding equilibrium between moving forward and maintaining stability. Many different computational approaches have been used to explain human walking mechanisms, from pendular model to fractal approaches. A new perspective can be gained from using the principles developed in the field of Optimization theory and in particularly the branch of Game Theory. In particular we provide a new insight into human walking showing as the trade-off between advancement and equilibrium managed during walking has the same solution of the Ultimatum game, one of the most famous paradigms of game theory, and this solution is the golden ratio. The golden ratio is an irrational number that was found in many biological and natural systems self-organized in a harmonic, asymmetric, and fractal structure. Recently, the golden ratio has also been found as the equilibrium point between two players involved into the Ultimatum Game. It has been suggested that this result can be due to the fact that the golden ratio is perceived as the fairest asymmetric solution by the two players. The golden ratio is also the most common proportion between stance and swing phase of human walking. This approach may explain the importance of harmony in human walking, and provide new perspectives for developing quantitative assessment of human walking, efficient humanoid robotic walkers, and effective neurorobots for rehabilitation.},

We construct several datasets for both accelerometer and gyroscope of three inertial measurement units and a smartphone around the waist of a subject, which include at most 744 subjects (389 males and 355 females) with ages ranging from 2 to 78 years. The database has several advantages: a large number of subjects with a balanced gender ratio, variations of sensor types, sensor locations, and ground slope conditions. Therefore, we can reliably analyze the dependence of gait authentication performance on a number of factors such as gender, age group, sensor type, ground condition, and sensor location. The results with the latest existing authentication methods provide several insights for these factors.},

	abstract = {The objective of our cross-sectional study was to investigate the changes associated with age and gender in walking speed, stride length and cadence of healthy women and men over the adult age range, and establish the effects of anthropometric indices such as height and body weight. We examined 118 women and 121 men (age range, 19-90 years). Subjects walked at their preferred speed over a 12-meter walkway crossing two Kistler force plates: cadence was calculated from heel strike times recorded from the Kistler force plates; walking speed was measured using an infrared reflecting system; and stride length was calculated from the walking speed and cadence. Older healthy subjects had lower values for walking speed and stride length than younger subjects. While there is little difference in the percentage reduction between women and men over the adult age range, the absolute values for walking speed are lower in women than men at all ages. In women, the percentage of explained variance for decline in walking speed was 30\%, and for decline in stride length 40\%. If body weight was also taken into account, the percentage of explained variance for walking speed was 37\%, and for stride length 59\%. A similar calculation for men yields 34\% for decline in walking speed, and 42\% for decline in stride length. Cadence was not associated with age, height and body weight. The standard errors for the estimates of walking speed in both women and men, respectively, are reduced by 8\% and 3\% using the multiple regression technique. The corresponding standard errors for stride length were reduced by, respectively, 19\% and 13\% if height in either sexes, or height and body weight in women, were taken into account. In conclusion, preferred walking speed and stride length decline with age in healthy people. Lower values found in old healthy subjects partly contributed to the difference in height and body weight between old and young subjects. Cadence was not correlated with age, height and body weight.

	abstract = {The P-splines of Eilers and Marx (Stat Sci 11:89â121, 1996) combine a B-spline basis with a discrete quadratic penalty on the basis coefficients, to produce a reduced rank spline like smoother. P-splines have three properties that make them very popular as reduced rank smoothers: (i) the basis and the penalty are sparse, enabling efficient computation, especially for Bayesian stochastic simulation; (ii) it is possible to flexibly âmix-and-matchâ the order of B-spline basis and penalty, rather than the order of penalty controlling the order of the basis as in spline smoothing; (iii) it is very easy to set up the B-spline basis functions and penalties. The discrete penalties are somewhat less interpretable in terms of function shape than the traditional derivative based spline penalties, but tend towards penalties proportional to traditional spline penalties in the limit of large basis size. However part of the point of P-splines is not to use a large basis size. In addition the spline basis functions arise from solving functional optimization problems involving derivative based penalties, so moving to discrete penalties for smoothing may not always be desirable. The purpose of this note is to point out that the three properties of basis-penalty sparsity, mix-and-match penalization and ease of setup are readily obtainable with B-splines subject to derivative based penalization. The penalty setup typically requires a few lines of code, rather than the two lines typically required for P-splines, but this one off disadvantage seems to be the only one associated with using derivative based penalties. As an example application, it is shown how basis-penalty sparsity enables efficient computation with tensor product smoothers of scattered data.},

	abstract = {Gait, as a promising biometric for recognizing human identities, can be nonintrusively captured as a series of acceleration signals using wearable or portable smart devices. It can be used for access control. Most existing methods on accelerometer-based gait recognition require explicit step-cycle detection, suffering from cycle detection failures and intercycle phase misalignment. We propose a novel algorithm that avoids both the above two problems. It makes use of a type of salient points termed signature points (SPs), and has three components: 1) a multiscale SP extraction method, including the localization and SP descriptors; 2) a sparse representation scheme for encoding newly emerged SPs with known ones in terms of their descriptors, where the phase propinquity of the SPs in a cluster is leveraged to ensure the physical meaningfulness of the codes; and 3) a classifier for the sparse-code collections associated with the SPs of a series. Experimental results on our publicly available dataset of 175 subjects showed that our algorithm outperformed existing methods, even if the step cycles were perfectly detected for them. When the accelerometers at five different body locations were used together, it achieved the rank-1 accuracy of 95.8\% for identification, and the equal error rate of 2.2\% for verification.},

To be more specific, the used mobile device is the Google G1 phone containing the AK8976A embedded accelerometer sensor. The mobile device was placed at the hip on each volunteer to collect gait data. Preproccesing, cycle detection and recognition-analysis were applied to the acceleration signal. The performance of the system was evaluated having 51 volunteers and resulted in an equal error rate (EER) of 20\%.},

Applying cycle matching method on experimental data from 30 subjects, we obtained an encouraging EER (Equal Error Rate) of 1.6\% using sideway acceleration signals. In addition, our analysis indicate that performance is better with light shoes than with heavy shoes; and sideways motion appear to provide higher discrimination power compared to the up-down and forward-backward motions. Application area for such gait-based user authentication approach can be in improving security and usability of user authentication in emerging applications such as pervasive environment.},

A portable microprocessor-based data collection device was designed to measure the three-dimensional gait acceleration signals during human walking. The system consists of a tri-axial accelerometer, a MCU, 32 M bytes of RAM, and a data transfer module for data transfer. The device was fixed to the user's waist and three-dimensional acceleration signals were recorded at a sampling rate of 250 Hz. After completing the recording, data stored in the RAM were transferred to a personal computer for wavelet denoising, gait cycles dividing, and gait pattern extracting. Through the analysis in time domain and frequency domain, and using dynamic time warping to deal with the problems result from naturally occurring changes in walking speed, 1-nearest neighbor is used for individual identification. Experiments were performed on 21 subjects walking on their normal speed. The methods of gait analysis in time domain and frequency domain are applying, the equal error rate of 5.6\% and 21.1\% are achieved respectively. Our preliminary results indicate that it is possible to recognize users based on their gait acceleration.},

Passwords and conventional biometrics such as fingerprint recognition offer fairly reliable solutions to this problem, but these methods require explicit user authentication and are used mainly when a mobile device is being switched on. Furthermore, conventional biometrics are sometimes perceived as privacy threats. This paper presents an unobtrusive method of user authentication for mobile devices in the form of recognition of the walking style (gait) and voice of the user while carrying and using the device. While speaker recognition in noisy conditions performs poorly, combined speaker and accelerometer-based gait recognition performs significantly better. In tentative tests with 31 users the Equal Error Rate varied between 2\% and 12\% depending on noise conditions, typically less than half of the Equal Error Rates of individual modalities.},
